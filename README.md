I'm Josh from Texas, and I am an aspriring front-end developer. I enjoy acquiring new skills and enhancing old ones. I recently graduated from Sam Houston State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am extremely excited for the future has to offer me. Right now my GitHub is empty, but I am hoping to add to it as I complete more projects.
