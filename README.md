My name is Josh, I'm from Texas, and I am an aspriring front-end developer. I enjoy acquiring new skills, enhancing old ones, and am always looking to expand my knowledge! I recently graduated from Sam Houston State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. While looking for my first job, I am working on many projects in my free time utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
